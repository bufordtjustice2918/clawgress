# Interface definition starts with interfaceDefinition tag that may contain node tags
start = element interfaceDefinition

# Those are intermediate configuration nodes that may only contain
# other nodes and must not have values
node = element node

# Tag nodes are containers for nodes without predefined names, like network interfaces
# or user names (e.g. "show interfaces ethernet ethX").
# Operational mode tag nodes can be parents to other tag nodes,
# like in "ping <host> count <packets>".
#
# Some commands can be called either with or without arguments,
# like "show interfaces ethernet eth0" (show info for eth0 only)
# or "show interfaces ethernet" (show info about all ethernet interfaces).
# That case is handled using the <standalone> element
tagNode = element tagNode
{
    nodeNameAttr,
    (properties? & standalone? & children? & command?)

# The <standalone> element is only used inside tag nodes
# to define their behavior when they are called without arguments
# It can provide a help string and a command.
# Everything else is handled in the <tagNode> itself.
standalone = element standalone

# Leaf nodes are terminal configuration nodes that can't have children,
# but can have values.

# Normal and tag nodes may have children

# For simplicity, any property is allowed in any node,
# but whether they are used or not is implementation-defined

# completionHelp tags contain information about allowed values of a node that is used for generating
# tab completion in the CLI frontend and drop-down lists in GUI frontends
# It is only meaningful for leaf nodes
# Allowed values can be given as a fixed list of values (e.g. <list>foo bar baz</list>),
# as a configuration path (e.g. <path>interfaces ethernet</path>),
# as a path to a script file that generates the list (e.g. <script>/usr/lib/foo/list-things</script>,
# or to enable built-in image path completion (<imagePath/>).
